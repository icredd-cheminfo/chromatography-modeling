# chromatography-modeling
Data and supplementary information (modeling files etc) for the chromatography predictive modeling paper (https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-s2qhv).

Three Jupyter notebooks are provided witht he underlying data:

1. Initial chromatograms and extraction of data from them.

2. Modeling benchmark with cross-validation on the whole set (64 molecules) and external set predictions.

3. Cross-validation and external prediction on an in-set separation (50 molecules as training and 14 as a test set, taken from the original set).

Chython and DOPtools are required for most visulizations. HPLCAnalysis required for the chromatogram analysis.
